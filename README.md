# The face mask detection model utilizes the MobileNet architecture along with a dataset sourced from Kaggle to determine whether a person in a real-time video feed is wearing a mask or not. It has the capability to detect if the person is wearing a mask correctly, wearing a mask incorrectly, or not wearing a mask at all. This technology is crucial for enforcing mask-wearing mandates in various public settings such as offices and schools.
